# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a modern, responsive Todo List application that integrates with external APIs for data management. The application will be built using vanilla HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap framework), and ES6 JavaScript in a modular architecture. It will provide users with a complete task management experience including viewing, searching, filtering, and adding todos with proper error handling and loading states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of todos fetched from an API, so that I can see all available tasks in an organized manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch todos from the dummy API using GET request
2. WHEN todos are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display them in a visually appealing list format
3. WHEN the API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN todos are displayed THEN each todo SHALL show task name, creation date, and completion status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new todos through a form, so that I can create new tasks and save them via API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL provide an "Add Todo" form with required fields
2. WHEN I fill out the form and submit THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the API
3. WHEN the todo is successfully created THEN the system SHALL update the todo list without requiring a page refresh
4. IF the POST request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the form data intact
5. WHEN submitting the form THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before making the API call
6. WHEN the form is being submitted THEN the system SHALL show a loading state and disable the submit button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search todos by task name, so that I can quickly find specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL filter the displayed todos in real-time
2. WHEN the search query matches todo titles THEN the system SHALL show only matching results
3. WHEN the search input is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all todos again
4. WHEN no todos match the search query THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter todos by date range, so that I can view tasks created within specific time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL provide "From Date" and "To Date" input fields
2. WHEN I select a date range and apply the filter THEN the system SHALL show only todos created within that range
3. WHEN only "From Date" is selected THEN the system SHALL show todos created from that date onwards
4. WHEN only "To Date" is selected THEN the system SHALL show todos created up to that date
5. WHEN the date filter is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all todos again
6. WHEN invalid date ranges are entered THEN the system SHALL show appropriate validation messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through todos using pagination, so that I can manage large lists of tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more than 10 todos THEN the system SHALL implement client-side pagination
2. WHEN pagination is active THEN the system SHALL show page numbers and navigation controls
3. WHEN I click on a page number THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding set of todos
4. WHEN I use next/previous buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate to adjacent pages appropriately
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN pagination SHALL work with the filtered results
6. WHEN on the last page THEN the "Next" button SHALL be disabled
7. WHEN on the first page THEN the "Previous" button SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show appropriate offline messaging
3. WHEN the API returns invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle it without breaking the application
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide options to retry the failed operation
5. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize and display the most relevant error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be modular and maintainable, so that it's easy to understand, extend, and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the code THEN the system SHALL separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files
2. WHEN structuring JavaScript THEN the system SHALL use ES6 modules and classes for organization
3. WHEN writing CSS THEN the system SHALL use Bootstrap framework with custom styles in separate files
4. WHEN creating components THEN each SHALL have a single responsibility and clear interface
5. WHEN naming files and functions THEN the system SHALL use descriptive, human-readable names
6. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL include appropriate comments and documentation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be visually elegant and responsive, so that I can use it comfortably on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean user interface
2. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt responsively using Bootstrap grid system
3. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover states, focus indicators)
4. WHEN loading or processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading animations
5. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography, spacing, and color scheme
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate visual styling (colors, icons)
